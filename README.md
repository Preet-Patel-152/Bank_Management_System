# Secure Bank Management System (CLI)

A robust, object-oriented banking application built in Python that simulates real-world account management. This project demonstrates clean architecture, defensive programming, and persistent state handling within a command-line interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure login system requiring valid account holder credentials.

- **Defensive Programming**  
  Extensive input validation using `try-except` blocks and guard clauses to prevent crashes from invalid data types, empty input, or malformed commands.

- **Financial Integrity Controls**  
  Business rules enforce:
  - No overdrafts
  - No negative deposits or withdrawals
  - No unauthorized transactions

- **Transaction Audit Trail**  
  Every deposit, withdrawal, and security update (password change) is recorded per account.

- **Object-Oriented Architecture**  
  Core banking logic is encapsulated in a dedicated account class, fully separated from the user interface layer.

- **Persistent Storage**  
  Account data is serialized to JSON, allowing application state to persist across program executions.
